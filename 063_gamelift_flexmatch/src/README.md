This repository contains a sample game project using Amazon GameLift and AWS serverless services including DynamoDB, Lambda, SQS, S3, and so on. This is a simple board game called [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku), but technically and functionally identical to a real-time session-based online game.

- For Infra/System engineers, this project shows how to build a session-based online game directly on AWS. It also demonstrates the benefits of AWS managed services such as GameLift.
- For game developers, this project provides architecture best practice and implementations of the most similar form to the actual session-based online game service. So they can leverage this asset to implement their own session-based online game on AWS.

# CloudFormation

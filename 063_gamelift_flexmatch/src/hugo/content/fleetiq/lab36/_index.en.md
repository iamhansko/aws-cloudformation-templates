1. Move to Cloud9 IDE on the server instance.

2. Run script with Python 3 as follows.

3. When the server is running, it will wait for the client to connect. Next, go to the client Cloud9 IDE to launch the client.

4. Run the client script in the same way. The echo client will run as follows!     Now check the TCP socket communication with the server.

5. It is noteworthy that the session connection was configured with an efficient instance based on the Fiesta algorithm by receiving connection information from the FleetIQ service. Now you can flexibly and cost-effectively build session-based gaming services with standalone FleetIQ capabilities.

**Congratulation! This is all for this FleetIQ lab. You can also refer more on [This link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gsg-intro.html)**
